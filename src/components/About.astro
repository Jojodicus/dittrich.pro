            This site collects my work and notes around backend engineering,
            HPC, low-level programming, embedded systems, virtualization, and
            containerization. Some of it is writing, some of it is
            documentation, some of it is experiments that turned out useful
            enough to publish.
          </p>
          <p class="text-dark-text-muted leading-relaxed">
            Most of this comes from hands-on work with production systems,
            homelabs, and open source. I care about simple designs, clear
            trade-offs, and explanations that don't hide complexity behind
            buzzwords.
